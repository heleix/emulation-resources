        <h1>What you need for emulation</h1>
        
        <p>Now that we have the concept of emulation down, the specifics to actually emulate something can vary widely based on the content and presentation needs. In this section we'll discuss what you'll need to consider to implement emulation for access to your archival material.</p>
        
        <h2>Know Your Content</h2>
        
        <p>Review your documentation. Does the original software indicate system requirements required to run it? Do you know what kind of computer was originally used to create the file? All documentation will be useful to determining the appropriate emulation environment. In addition, take careful note of any information you can gather while investigating your digital content. This will become important documentation for future archivists!</p>
        
        <p>Analyzing file formats. Not all formats with the same extension are actually the same! Tools like <a href="https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo">MediaInfo</a>, <a href="http://jhove.openpreservation.org/">JHOVE</a>, and <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/">DROID</a> can extract technical information about a file to indicate a corresponding computing environment. DROID refers to the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx">PRONOM technical registry</a> to identify file formats.</p>
        
        <p>For software-based artworks, consider the following typology:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Contained</dt>
          <dd>Software is wholly contained within itself.</dd>
          <dt>Networked</dt>
          <dd>Software relies on network connections to access information or perform actions.</dd>
          <dt>User-dependent</dt>
          <dd>Software relies on user input to function.</dd>
          <dt>Generative</dt>
          <dd>Software is constantly changing as a result of outside connections or input.</dd>
        </dl>
              
        <h2>Look and Feel</h2>
        
        <p>Finding an emulation environment and software that can render your digital content may only be the first step to providing access. These may also be described as the "look and feel" of the digital content. 
        
        <p>Significant properties differ depending on the nature of the digital object. Is it necessary to provide an exact replica of the digital content as it would have been experienced when originally created? If you are primarily interested in the content of a text document, then software that fails to render all of the original formatting may be sufficient. Alternatively, being able to interact with complex software or video games may be crucial in any emulation.</p>
        
        <p>Tip: If you're in touch with the original creator of the digital content, discuss their desires for emulation and what they consider significant. Time-based media artists may have particular ideas about how best to present their work with newer technology.</p>
        
        <p>Rendering display. Processing speed.</p>
        
        <p>For interactive software and video games, emulation through software may not be enough to recreate the significant properties of interacting with the content. Consider the difference between playing an Atari game with joystick controller versus that same game emulated on a modern computer with keyboard and mouse. 
        
        <blockquote>
        <p><u>Try it out</u>: The Internet Archive has a vast software library, including thousands of video games that can be emulated on the website, but little information about how the controls correspond to computer keyboards. <a href="https://archive.org/details/atari_2600_library">Consider trying a few out.</a> How does playing these games online compare to using a joystick?</p>
