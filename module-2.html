        <h1>What you need for emulation</h1>
        
        <p>Now that we understand the basics of emulation, the specifics to actually emulate something can vary widely based on the content and presentation needs. These specifics can be very technical very quickly, so in this section we'll focus on larger concepts to consider to implement emulation for access to your archival material.</p>
        
        <h2>Know Your Content!</h2>
        
        <p>You have something you want emulation to help you access, but what is it, exactly? When we use computers to run software and look at files, we are engaging a complex stack that involves hardware, operating system environments, software, and files themselves. Effective emulation will require determining the appropriate combination of these elements to produce the access result you want. Emulation removes the hardware component, but the other three must be considered.</p>

        <h3>Review your documentation</h3>
        
        <p>Start by looking over any documentation you have to accompany the digital content you want to emulate. Is there any accompanying text or labels that indicate system requirements required to run it? Do you know what kind of computer was originally used to create the file? All documentation will be useful to determining the appropriate emulation environment. In addition, take careful note of any information you can gather while investigating your digital content. This will become important documentation for future archivists!</p>
        
        <h3>Analyzing file formats and content</h3>
        
        <p>Not all formats with the same extension are actually the same! Tools like <a href="https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo">MediaInfo</a>, <a href="http://jhove.openpreservation.org/">JHOVE</a>, and <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/">DROID</a> can extract technical information about a file to indicate a corresponding computing environment. DROID refers to the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx">PRONOM technical registry</a> to identify file formats.</p>
        
        <p>Understanding the specifics of your file will help determine the appropriate software needed to display it.</p>
        
        <h3>Analyzing software</h3>
        
        <p>All files require software to display their content. Some will require proprietary programs to match proprietary formats (such as Adobe Photoshop files only opening in Adobe). In some cases, alternative or open-source software can be used to access files, even if they weren't the original creation program. Using alternative software requires additional consideration concerning the "look and feel" of the original file (see below).</p>
        
        <p>EaaSI's Universal Virtual Indicator that can match files to required software and dependencies</p>
        
        <p>In other cases, emulating software may be the main issue for access. This includes video games and many instances of time-based media.</p>
              
        <p>For software-based artworks, consider the following typology:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Contained</dt>
          <dd>Software is wholly contained within itself.</dd>
          <dt>Networked</dt>
          <dd>Software relies on network connections to access information or perform actions.</dd>
          <dt>User-dependent</dt>
          <dd>Software relies on user input to function.</dd>
          <dt>Generative</dt>
          <dd>Software is constantly changing as a result of outside connections or input.</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <h3>Analyzing environments</h3>
        
        <p>The computing environment will ultimately determine your emulation needs. Do you need software that runs on particular versions of Apple Mac operating systems? Windows? As the next lesson will indicate, most emulators focus on emulating a specific environment in which different software and content can be loaded</p>
              
        <h2>Look and Feel</h2>
        
        <p>Finding an emulation environment and software that can render your digital content may only be the first step to providing access. These may also be described as the "look and feel" of the digital content. 
        
        <p>Significant properties differ depending on the nature of the digital object. Is it necessary to provide an exact replica of the digital content as it would have been experienced when originally created? If you are primarily interested in the content of a text document, then software that fails to render all of the original formatting may be sufficient. Alternatively, being able to interact with complex software or video games may be crucial in any emulation.</p>
        
        <p><i><u>Tip</u>: If you're in touch with the original creator of the digital content, discuss their desires for emulation and what they consider significant. Time-based media artists may have particular ideas about how best to present their work with newer technology.</i></p>
        
        <p>Rendering display. Processing speed.</p>
        
        <p>For interactive software and video games, emulation through software may not be enough to recreate the significant properties of interacting with the content. Consider the difference between playing an Atari game with joystick controller versus that same game emulated on a modern computer with keyboard and mouse.

        <p><u>Try it out</u>: The Internet Archive's software library includes thousands of video games that can be emulated on the website but often without information about how the controls correspond to modern computer keyboards. <a href="https://archive.org/details/atari_2600_library">Try playing a few from the Atari 2600 collection.</a> How does playing these games online compare to using a joystick?</p>
