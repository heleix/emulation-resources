        <h1>What is emulation?</h1>
        <p>The rise and significance of emulation can be attributed to a community outside of a formalized, professional sphere: video games and their enthusiasts. With enthusiasm comes a need for the access of digital artifacts industry-driven changes in technology have provided little to no options for&mdash;a call both archivists and gamers can agree with. The practice of emulation remains as a tool all archivists should learn more about for digital workflows.</p>

        <p>This foundational history brings us to the role of emulation within digital preservation practices. Per traditional dictionary definitions, to emulate means to strive to equal or imitate. An emulator is the means that allows us to do exactly that.</p>

        <p>Jon Ippolito, a Professor of New Media at the University of Maine who has spoken extensively on technological obsolescence and the preservation of media art, defines emulation as “a computer program that ‘fools’ the original code into assuming that it is still running on its original equipment, thus enabling software from an out-of-date computer to run on a contemporary one.” (116) Simply stated, the act of emulation can allow archivists to access digital artifacts that are considered obsolete according to today’s technologies. Emulation provides avenues for challenging obsolescence by enabling other means of access.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Example Cases</h2>
        <blockquote>

        <p>To better what emulation can do and what it can be used for, let’s look at the following two examples.</p>
      </blockquote>
        <p>Archivists and cultural heritage institutions have utilized emulation for accessing digital files and artworks. In 2014, Iontank, a specialized design studio developing interactive art installations and software systems, worked with the Andy Warhol Museum to display digital artwork created on the Commodore Amiga 1000 computer in the 1980s. Iontank created their own Amiga 1000 emulator to make the files, which were stored on a floppy disk, viewable. In addition, the company preserved the look and feel of viewing the artworks on the same computer, just as if one were doing so back in the 1980s. Decommissioned Amiga 1000s were used for the display and the internal components of the computer were replaced with new hardware.

        <p>More recently, the Born-Digital Preservation Lab at Stanford University Libraries used emulation to access “The Would-Be Gentleman,” a floppy disk simulation created by Stanford history professor Carolyn Lougee in 1985 and used for her History seminar, “The France of Louis XIV.” To do this work, the Digital Archivist at Stanford University partnered with the Software Preservation Analyst at Emulation-as-a-Service Infrastructure (EaaSI), a group of organizations working together to develop technology and scale of Emulation-as-Service software. A main hurdle in their work included uncertainty over which emulator to use.

        <h2>What other options do I have besides emulation?</h2>
        <p>Emulation isn't an elixir for all digital file challenges and this guide doesn't aim to propose it as a one-size-fits-all solution. It all depends on what you're doing and the financial and technical resources available to you. Let's compare it with some other options.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Emulation vs. Migration</h3>
        <p>Emulation offers extensibility, a systems design principle in software engineering that is defined as a measure of the ability to extend a system and the level of effort required to implement the given function. Deeper emulators can operate on a hardware level. For example, computer manufacturers such as Dell and Apple detail specifications similarly as time goes by given the mass production scale of hardware.

        <p>This quality of hardware makes it easier for creators of emulators to match a broader range of specifications. Long story short, emulators don't often have to be replaced for each operating system version and configuration. Once you've emulated a chip, you're also able to access every other file that runs on the same chip.</p>

        <p>On the other end, migration must be reperformed on a case-by-case basis for each artifact on various platforms. You risk the chance of losing functionality of digital artifacts during the process, as modern-day technology may not have the same specifications needed to open the file to its full capacity. Each successive translation to new technology introduces new losses. To quote Jeff Rothenberg, one of the most notable researchers and advocates of emulation: "Like an illiterate monk dutifully copying text in a lost language, migration may save the bits but lose their meaning."</p>

        Emulation can save time and efforts in the long run if you're working with a large amount of digital artifacts that operate on similar specifications as it can mimic the exact environment that the artifacts need to run on. However, emulation requires technical knowledge and a legal framework to be figured out in advance. We'll talk more about intellectual property issues below.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Emulation vs. Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Virtualization is "a technique for implementing a virtual machine (VM) on a host computer" with a VM defined as "a computer that has no separate physical existence, but is part of a behavior of a physical computer, which is called the VM's host computer." (Rosenthal) In other words, it makes it possible for the virtual machine to run directly on the given hardware by creating a simulated environment whre one operating system can run on top of another.</p>

        <p>Emulation requires a software bridge to interact with the hardware while virtualization accesses hardware directly. Because of this, it is less CPU-intensive than emulation. However, virtualization can only run software that the underlying hardware is already capable of running.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Intellectual Property</h1>
        <p>Before you embark on an emulation project, know there are legal implications involved. Quick word of advice is to always err on the side of caution, especially if you're doing work on behalf of a client or institution. While we can't control everything you choose to do, here are some legal and ethical considerations to keep in mind before you move forward.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <img src="tip.png" alt="White speech bubble with a light bulb." align="left" />
        <p><b>Tip:</b> Laws will vary depending on where you are based. This guide will speak from a U.S.-perspective. We are also not trained lawyers, so we suggest you seek appropriate council if you are working with a more difficult situation to navigate.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <br>
        <h2>Software Copyright</h2>
        <p>Software and its hardware-specific variant known as firmware must always be assumed to be under copyright. In the U.S., computer programs are considered literary works under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101" target="_blank">Title 17 of the United States Code</a> outlining U.S. copyright law. In addition, the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/dmca/" target="_blank">Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA)</a> makes it illegal to bypass any form of copy protection. These forms of protection are often known as Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies.</p>

        <p>Video game developers have been known to go after others developing emulators for game access. In 2017, Atlus, a Japanese video game developer, filed a DCMA takedown against the creators of the open-source Playstation 3 emulator <a href="https://rpcs3.net/" target="_blank">RPCS3</a>, notable for running the video game Persona 5. The emulator's Patreon page was advertising access to the game by emulating playability on a PC.</p>
        <p>Note that the emulator RPCS3 is still up and running despite the takedown notice, given the existence of the emulator itself is legal. It is the claim of having access to content under copyright, the video game, that takes the situation into murkier waters. ROMs, short for read-only-memory, store data for videogames and cannot be electronically modified per copyright. Running the ROM through the emulator can be considered a modification and new means of distribution and access, and thus a potential infringement of copyright law according to DCMA. The two groups eventually settled by having RPCS3 remove all references of the video game from their Patreon page.</p>

        <p>This example is only one of many, many of which have lead to varying results between groups. However, while the example is in the video game realm, this illustrates the kinds of legal challenges that can arise.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Layered Rights</h2>
        <p>Another complication that can arise are layered rights. A copyright owner of a work can transfer their rights to you for a project, however, there may be other rights embedded <i>within</i> the work that cannot be transferred over. Some rights may be specific to a certain use or instance.</p>

        <p>For example, the creator of the work may have secured their own rights for using another work within the final project. This can be the use of a font, song, photograph, or a moving image clip&mdash;all of which are considered works that may have their own copyright protections on top of the entire work itself. The creator may have the right for use, however, you as another entity using and redistributing the work may not.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <img src="tip.png" alt="White speech bubble with a light bulb." align="left" />
        <p><b>Tip:</b> We suggest you have all documentation of copyright agreements available from a donor before beginning an emulation project. You don't want to invest work and efforts and then come across copyright hurdles hindering you from making your work accessible!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Agreements may sometimes be lost over time or untraceable. This is where professional ethics and case-by-case judgments can step in. If there is a popular Top 40 song or footage from a film licensed by a large production studio within the work, you may need further documentation and certainty of copyright agreements before you move forward. If you decide to move forward and accept potential risks, note that you and your institution may be issued a DCMA takedown notice by a copyright holder or creator.

        <p>Lastly, some works or individuals within the work may also be unwilling to be included within an emulation project and not have copyright laws from a legal framework to protect themselves and their interests. For example, while legal frameworks exist for certain works, working with Indigenous materials is oftentimes moreso guided by ethical frameworks implemented by practioners in the archival field rather than legal ones.</p>

        <p>We hope you'll approach an ethics of care in your work. Talk to other archives colleagues and read publications in the field to learn from others' work and experiences. Learn from the communities you work with and for. These practices can help inform your own ethics as an archival professional.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>A Fair Use Argument for Emulation</h2>
        <p>Access is a defining motive for many archivists. With access comes risks, specifically copyright law as this section discussed.
