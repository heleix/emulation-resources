        <h1>What is emulation?</h1>
        <p>The rise and significance of emulation can be attributed to a community outside of a formalized, professional sphere: video games and their enthusiasts. With enthusiasm comes a need for the access of digital files and artifacts industry-driven changes in technology have provided little to no options for&mdash;a call both archivists and gamers can agree with. The practice of emulation remains as a tool all archivists should learn more about for digital workflows.</p>

        <p>This foundational history brings us to the role of emulation within digital preservation practices. Per traditional dictionary definitions, to emulate means to strive to equal or imitate. An emulator is the means that allows us to do exactly that.</p>

        <p>Jon Ippolito, a Professor of New Media at the University of Maine who has spoken extensively on technological obsolescence and the preservation of media art, defines emulation as “a computer program that ‘fools’ the original code into assuming that it is still running on its original equipment, thus enabling software from an out-of-date computer to run on a contemporary one.” Simply stated, the act of emulation can allow archivists to access files and content that are considered obsolete according to today’s software and hardware technologies. Emulation provides avenues for challenging obsolescence.</p>

        <h2>Example Cases</h2>
        <p>To better what emulation can do and what it can be used for, let’s look at some examples.</p> 

        <p>Archivists and cultural heritage institutions have utilized emulation for accessing digital files and artworks. In 2014, Iontank, a specialized design studio developing interactive art installations and software systems, worked with the Andy Warhol Museum to display digital artwork created on the Commodore Amiga 1000 computer in the 1980s. Iontank created their own Amiga 1000 emulator to make the files, stored on a floppy disk, viewable. In addition, the company preserved the look and feel of viewing the artworks on the same computer, just as if one were doing so back in the 1980s. In addition to the emulator, decommissioned Amiga 1000s were used for the display and the internal components of the computer were replaced with new hardware.

        <p>More recently, the Born-Digital Preservation Lab (BDPL) at Stanford University Libraries used emulation to access “The Would-Be Gentleman,” a floppy disk simulation created by Stanford history professor Carolyn Lougee in 1985 and used for her History seminar, “The France of Louis XIV.” To do this work, the Digital Archivist at Stanford University partnered with the Software Preservation Analyst at Emulation-as-a-Service Infrastructure (EaaSI), a group of organizations working together to develop technology and scale of Emulation-as-Service software. A main hurdle in their work included uncertainty over which emulator to use.
