        <h1>What is emulation?</h1>
        <p>The rise and significance of emulation can be attributed to a community outside of a formalized, professional sphere: video games and their enthusiasts. With enthusiasm comes a need for the access of digital artifacts industry-driven changes in technology have provided little to no options for&mdash;a call both archivists and gamers can agree with. The practice of emulation remains as a tool all archivists should learn more about for digital workflows.</p>

        <p>This foundational history brings us to the role of emulation within digital preservation practices. Per traditional dictionary definitions, to emulate means to strive to equal or imitate. An emulator is the means that allows us to do exactly that.</p>

        <p>Jon Ippolito, a Professor of New Media at the University of Maine who has spoken extensively on technological obsolescence and the preservation of media art, defines emulation as “a computer program that ‘fools’ the original code into assuming that it is still running on its original equipment, thus enabling software from an out-of-date computer to run on a contemporary one.” (116) Simply stated, the act of emulation can allow archivists to access digital artifacts that are considered obsolete according to today’s technologies. Emulation provides avenues for challenging obsolescence by enabling other means of access.</p>

        <h2>Example Cases</h2>
        <blockquote>

        <p>To better what emulation can do and what it can be used for, let’s look at the following two examples.</p>
      </blockquote>
        <p>Archivists and cultural heritage institutions have utilized emulation for accessing digital files and artworks. In 2014, Iontank, a specialized design studio developing interactive art installations and software systems, worked with the Andy Warhol Museum to display digital artwork created on the Commodore Amiga 1000 computer in the 1980s. Iontank created their own Amiga 1000 emulator to make the files, which were stored on a floppy disk, viewable. In addition, the company preserved the look and feel of viewing the artworks on the same computer, just as if one were doing so back in the 1980s. Decommissioned Amiga 1000s were used for the display and the internal components of the computer were replaced with new hardware.

        <p>More recently, the Born-Digital Preservation Lab at Stanford University Libraries used emulation to access “The Would-Be Gentleman,” a floppy disk simulation created by Stanford history professor Carolyn Lougee in 1985 and used for her History seminar, “The France of Louis XIV.” To do this work, the Digital Archivist at Stanford University partnered with the Software Preservation Analyst at Emulation-as-a-Service Infrastructure (EaaSI), a group of organizations working together to develop technology and scale of Emulation-as-Service software. A main hurdle in their work included uncertainty over which emulator to use.

        <h2>What other options do I have besides emulation?</h2>
        <p>Emulation isn't an elixir for all digital file challenges, and this guide doesn't aim to propose it as a one-size-fits-all solution. It all depends on what you're doing and the financial and technical resources available to you. Let's compare it with some other options.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Emulation vs. Migration</h3>
        <p>Emulation offers extensibility, a systems design principle in software engineering that is defined as a measure of the ability to extend a system and the level of effort required to implement the given function. Deeper emulators can operate on a hardware level. For example, computer manufacturers such as Dell and Apple detail specifications similarly as time goes by, given the mass production scale of hardware.

        <p>This quality of hardware makes it easier for creators of emulators to match a broader range of specifications. Long story short, emulators don't often have to be replaced for each operating system version and configuration. Once you've emulated a chip, you're also able to access every other file that runs on the same chip.</p>

        <p>On the other end, migration must be reperformed on a case-by-case basis for each artifact on various platforms. You risk the chance of losing functionality of digital artifacts during the process, as modern-day technology may not have the same specifications needed to open the file to its full capacity. Each successive translation to new technology introduces new losses. To quote Jeff Rothenberg, one of the most notable researchers and advocates of emulation: "Like an illiterate monk dutifully copying text in a lost language, migration may save the bits but lose their meaning."</p>

        Emulation can save time and efforts in the long run if you're working with a large amount of digital artifacts that operate on similar specifications as it can mimic the exact environment that the artifacts need to run on. However, emulation requires technical knowledge and a legal framework to be figured out in advance. We'll talk more about intellectual property issues below.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Emulation vs. Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Virtualization is "a technique for implementing a virtual machine (VM) on a host computer" with a VM defined as "a computer that has no separate physical existence, but is part of a behavior of a physical computer, which is called the VM's host computer." (Rosenthal) In other words, it makes it possible for the virtual machine to run directly on the given hardware by creating a simulated environment whre one operating system can run on top of another.</p>

        <p>Emulation requires a software bridge to interact with the hardware while virtualization accesses hardware directly. Because of this, it is less CPU-intensive than emulation. However, virtualization can only run software that the underlying hardware is already capable of running.</p>
