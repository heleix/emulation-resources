        <h1>Getting started</h1>
        <p>Here are some things you should know before you get started:

          <p>To return to the home page, click the computer with the two mountains in the header. You can also toggle between each module using the links underneath it.</p>
          <br>  
        <blockquote>
          <img src="mouse.png" alt="White computer mouse with two buttons." align="left" />
          <p>This blockquote with the computer mouse indicates there is an activity which will link to a page from another organization. Some of these will be additional sources to skim or more interactive activities, such as a web-based emulator.
          </blockquote>
            <br>
          <blockquote>
          <img src="tip.png" alt="White speech bubble with a light bulb." align="left" />
          <p>This blockquote with the speech bubble and light bulb indicates a tip. This will help highlight a foundational takeaway for a section.
          </blockquote>
          <br>
          <blockquote>
          <img src="quiz.png" alt="White speech bubbles, one with a question mark." align="left" />
          <p>This blockquote with the speech bubbles indicates there is a quiz. Don't worry, no one is grading you. This is just an opportunity for you to gauge your understanding and see what topics you may need to revisit.
          </blockquote>
  <br>
          <p>Now that you know more about how this lesson is structured, you're ready to start <a href="module-1.html">Module 1</a> where you'll learn a brief history about emulation and what it's used for.</p>
