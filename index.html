        <p>This is a general lesson in emulation for archivistsâ€”especially for those with little to no experience, have no idea what emulation is, or want to learn more about how emulation can be used for archival workflows. We'll build an understanding of emulation by starting with foundational concepts and advancing in each module.

        <h2>How to use this guide</h2>
         <p>This is an asynchronous lesson designed to take up <strong>45-60 minutes</strong>. There are three separate modules estimated to take 15-20 minutes each, including links and exercises. However, you may return to specific modules or spend more time with others if needed.</p>
         <br>
         <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
         <p>While this guide is designed for beginners, we expect you to have a basic understanding of computing and information technologies to follow along. You should be able to understand what an operating system is and explain elementary differences between network infrastructures, hardware, software, and digital media formats.</p>
