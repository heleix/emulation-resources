        <p>This is a general introduction to emulation for archivistsâ€”especially for those with little to no experience, have no idea what emulation is, or want to learn more about how emulation can be used for archival workflows. We'll build an understanding of emulation by making our way through beginner concepts and advancing as we go along.
