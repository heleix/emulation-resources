        <p>This is a general lesson in emulation for archivistsâ€”especially for those with little to no experience, have no idea what emulation is, or want to learn more about how emulation can be used for archival workflows. We'll build an understanding of emulation by making our way through foundational concepts and advancing as we go along.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>How to Use This Guide</h2>
         <p>This is an asynchronous lesson. Following along with the entirety of this lesson is designed to take up <u><b>45-60 minutes</b></u>. The guide is divided into three separate modules estimated to take 15-20 minutes each. However, you may return to specific modules or spend more time with others if needed.</p>

         <p>While this guide is designed for beginners, we expect you to have a basic understanding of computing and information technologies, e.g. you should be able to understand what an operating system is and explain elementary differences between hardware, software, and digital media formats.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
        <p>By completing this lesson, you should be able to:</p>
        <p>
          - Acquire a basic understanding of emulation technology
          <br>
          - Consider how emulation would be useful for archivists
          <br>
          - Become aware of various considerations for implementing emulation as an access strategy
          <br>
          - Use emulation to solve an example access problem
        </p>
