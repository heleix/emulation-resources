        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <p>Let's review the learning objectives and connect them to what we've covered:</p>
        <h3><i>- Acquire a basic understanding of emulation technology</i></h3>
        <p>Module 1 covered a basic cultural history of emulation and a general definition. We then learned about understanding your content, analyzing file formats, and the importance of rendering the original "look and feel" of content for emulation projects in Module 2.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>- Consider how emulation would be useful for archivists</i></h3>
        <p>We also learned in Module 1 that emulation provides avenues for challenging digital format obsolescence by enabling other means of access. The brief activity in this module also asked you to look at emulation projects at the Andy Warhol Museum and the Born-Digital Preservation Lab at Stanford University.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>- Become aware of various considerations for implementing emulation as an access strategy</i></h3>
        <p>The later half of Module 1 spoke at length about ethical and legal considerations for emulation projects. Consider both legal frameworks such as copyright and layered rights and ethical considerations as an archival professional. Always err on the side of caution regaring intellectual property rights.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><i>- Use emulation to solve an example access problem</i></h3>
        <p>In Module 3...</p>
